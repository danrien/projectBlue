## Contributing

All code considered guilty until proven innocent! Please ensure that your code is proven with unit 
tests before submitting a PR. No PR will be considered without the tests to back it up.

Folder structure is organized by *context*, or rather, it moves away from the "sock drawer" folder structure
that Android follows. It is inspired by this post on AngularJS project structure (another Google framework that
encourage sock drawer app structuring): http://cliffmeyers.com/blog/2013/4/21/code-organization-angularjs-javascript.
This means everything is logically grouped in nested folders based on feature. Unfortunately, some 
areas, such as the `res` folders, do not allow such structuring.

Finding issues and reporting them is also contributing to making project blue better! Please submit any 
issues that are found in the issues area.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on our code of conduct, and the 
process for submitting pull requests to us.
